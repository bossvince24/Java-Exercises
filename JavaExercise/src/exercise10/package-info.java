/*Consider a scenario where you are asked to model a system for managing employees 
in an organization. Implement the following:
Create a class named Employee with the following private attributes:
>id (int)
>name (String)
>salary (double)
-Provide appropriate getter and setter methods to access and modify these attributes.
-Create a subclass named Manager which inherits from the Employee class. 
-The Manager class should have an additional private attribute:
>department (String)
Provide a getter and setter method for the department attribute.
Ensure that you can create instances of both Employee and Manager classes and set their
attributes appropriately using constructors and methods.
Write a test program (a Main class) to demonstrate the functionality of both classes. 
Create instances of Employee and Manager, set their attributes, and display them.
